 * If the sum is 7 or 11 on the first roll, the player wins. If the sum is 2, 3 or 12 on the first roll the player loses.
 * If the sum is 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 or 10 on the first roll, that sum becomes the player’s “point”. To win, a
 * player must continue rolling the dice until the player rolls the point value. The player loses by
 * rolling a 7 before rolling the point.
